My 'Question and Answer Game, Loosely Based on Jeopardy'


                Setting Up

                                Categories

                                                Setting up the category names is pretty simple. Just enter the name you want into the respective text box under the General Configuration tab.

                                Questions

                                                Setting up the questions and answers is just as easy, as long as you can think up 30 of them.

                                Final Jeopardy

                                                A new feature in v6.1; also easy to use (I think you get the idea: it’s easy to use). Simply make sure the check-box is checked and enter your question and answer in their respective text boxes. When the check-box is checked, a button labeled “Final Jeopardy” will appear beneath the controls for the scoring system.

                                Saving and Loading

                                                A long awaited feature; still has its quirks, but it works well enough for now.

                                                To save, simply enter your questions, answers, and category names into their respective boxes, make sure you have a valid path in the path boxes (i.e. Your Desktop), and click save. Don’t do anything in the dialog box; just click ‘Save’. If everything worked correctly you should have a new folder in the location specified, with a folder inside under the name specified, with the questions and answers inside in text files. Savvy?

                                                To load, enter the path to the FIRST folder, and click load. Don’t do anything in the dialog box; just click ‘Load’. If everything worked correctly, everything should be where it should be.

                                                                Example: Let us assume you are Mrs. Woods

 First box= C:\Users\twoods\Desktop\Games\

                                                                                Second box= Macbeth Review

On the Desktop would be a folder named Games with a folder inside named Macbeth. Inside that folder would be the questions and answers in text files.





                                Teams

                                                This is just as easy as everything else; just select the number of teams you want (i.e. if you want 4 teams, click the check box for team 4), and enter names into the text boxes (If you want).



                                Timer

                                                Pretty intuitive, for the most part. 

                                Fonts

                                                The two buttons labeled for their respective fonts are still in Beta, so be careful. The default font is Agency FB, Bold, 20pt.



                Playing the Game

                                Once you get everything set up, switch to the tabs labeled ‘Play’, and get ready.

                                To get the question, click a point value on the right, and the question will be displayed in the panel on the left. To get the answer, click the panel on the left, and it will change to black background with white text, and display the answer.

    Scoring

                                When a question is selected, the respective point value will be displayed in the box below, to the right of the teams, and to the left of the timer, which will also be displayed (assuming it is enabled; will start if auto-start is enabled). When ready, make sure the correct team’s button is selected, and click one of the buttons located beneath the point box. + will add, - will subtract, = will do neither, 50% will divide the value in the box by 2.

    Timer

                                To start the timer manually, click the timer itself (in the lower right-hand corner), and double click to stop. The buttons underneath the timer add and subtract 5 seconds at a time, respectively.

                Final Jeopardy

                                When ready, click the button labeled ‘Final Jeopardy’ beneath the scoring controls. A new window will open, with the question and betting controls for the teams. Enter the bets and click the question area to get the answer. Select the appropriate check boxes for correct or incorrect answers, and click return. The points will be added or subtracted from the respective teams.
